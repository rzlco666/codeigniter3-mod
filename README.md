## How to use

After performing the installation and configuration, just call the method `$this->ci_seo->add_tags()` informing the parameters corresponding to the title, description and illustrative image of the page.

```
$this->ci_seo->add_tags('Page title', 'Page Description', 'image/path');
```

The `$this->ci_seo->add_tags()` method can be called either directly inside the `<head> </head>` tag or inside some method in the controller, returning the data to a variable that should be passed to the view should be retrieved inside `<head> </head>`.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
    <?= $this->ci_seo->add_tags('Page title', 'Page Description', 'image/path'); ?>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>
```
